First project "hello world."

~STRING SLICING~
a[start:stop]
start = index where slice begins 
stop = index where slice ends(that means it stops before this index)

~TASK EXPLANANTION~

2-print:
uses fucntion print() to print a sentence

3-print:

[0:9] is string slicing where in [x:0] x will slice the beginning of the sting and in [0:y] y will slice the end of the string

6-print:
same as others
but concatenate(combines) 2 strings 

7-print:

8-print:
