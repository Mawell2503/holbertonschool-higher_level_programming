Forth project
learning data structures:lists,tuples

~TASK EXPLANATION~

task 0:
    ~for syntax~
    for a, b in iterable():         |eg| example shown in task 0
    ......                          |eg|

        python assues that each item in iterable looks like this:
        (iten1, item2)
        which works with the task.

task 1:
----

task 2:
----

task 3:
    for --- range(start,stop,step)   |eg|  for -- (len(my_list)-1,-1,-1)
        basically tells the program to run the list backwords
        -1 -> start at last inde     #tells the program "start here"
        -1 -> stops before -1(stop at 0)    #tells the program "stops before x"
        -1 -> move backward by 1    #tells the program to increment or decrement

task 4:
    -- = my list[:]
        basically its list slicing  list[start:stop]
        leaving both the start and stop empty makes the program copy eveyrthing

    if 0 <= idx < len(new_list):
        basically ( 0 <= idx) and (idx < len(new_list))
